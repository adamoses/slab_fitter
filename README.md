# rot_fitter
rot_fitter is a set of python codes to perform MCMC fits to CO rotation digrams.  Code is currently
under development and is not ready for use.

# Requirements
Requires internet access to utilize astroquery.hitran and access HITRAN partition function files

Requires the molmass and astropy packages

## Functions
extract_hitran_data extracts relevant data from HITRAN database

compute_partition_function compute a partition function given a molecule, isotopologue, and temperature

compute_fluxes produces line fluxes given a set of line_ids

make_rotation_diagram computes abscissa and ordinate values for a rotation diagram, given line_ids

## Usage

```python

```
